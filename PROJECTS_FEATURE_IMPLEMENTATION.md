# Projects Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete project management feature with objectives, tasks, and sprints functionality. The implementation follows a clean architecture with proper separation of concerns.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
**File**: `src/models/Schema.ts`

- Added `userId` field to `projectsSchema`, `objectivesSchema`, `tasksSchema`, and `sprintsSchema`
- Added `startDate`, `endDate`, and `status` fields to `sprintsSchema`
- Updated all relations to include user ownership
- Migration generated and applied successfully

### 2. Validation Schemas ✅
Created comprehensive Zod validation schemas:

- `src/validations/ProjectValidation.ts` - Project CRUD validation
- `src/validations/ObjectiveValidation.ts` - Objective CRUD validation
- `src/validations/TaskValidation.ts` - Task CRUD validation with status/priority enums
- `src/validations/SprintValidation.ts` - Sprint CRUD validation with date fields

### 3. Service Layer ✅
Created service classes following the UserService pattern:

- `src/services/projectService.ts` - Complete CRUD + getProjectWithRelations
- `src/services/objectiveService.ts` - CRUD with project ownership verification
- `src/services/taskService.ts` - CRUD with project ownership verification
- `src/services/sprintService.ts` - CRUD with project ownership verification

All services include proper error handling and ownership verification.

### 4. API Routes ✅
Created RESTful API endpoints with Clerk authentication:

**Projects**:
- `GET /api/projects` - List all user projects
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects/[id]` - Get project with relations
- `PUT /api/projects/[id]` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` - Delete project

**Objectives**:
- `POST /api/objectives` - Create objective
- `PUT /api/objectives/[id]` - Update objective
- `DELETE /api/objectives/[id]` - Delete objective

**Tasks**:
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create task
- `PUT /api/tasks/[id]` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/[id]` - Delete task

**Sprints**:
- `POST /api/sprints` - Create sprint
- `PUT /api/sprints/[id]` - Update sprint
- `DELETE /api/sprints/[id]` - Delete sprint

### 5. UI Components ✅

**Breadcrumb Component**:
- `src/components/Breadcrumb.tsx` - Reusable breadcrumb navigation with MUI

**Projects Pages**:
- `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/projects/page.tsx` - Projects list page
- `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/projects/ProjectsList.tsx` - Project cards grid
- `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/projects/new/page.tsx` - New project page
- `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/projects/ProjectForm.tsx` - Project creation/edit form
- `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx` - Project detail page
- `src/app/[locale]/(auth)/dashboard/projects/[id]/ProjectDetail.tsx` - Project detail with objectives/tasks/sprints

### 6. Translations ✅
Added comprehensive translations to `en.json` and `fr.json`:

- Page titles and descriptions
- Form labels and placeholders
- Button labels
- Status and priority options
- Empty state messages
- Error messages
